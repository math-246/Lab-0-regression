# Lab-0-regression

In this lab, you will find a dataset which contains at least 2 numerical variables, then construct a linear regression model. In this write-up you should:

* Find a dataset with at least two numerical variables
* Create a scatterplot of these data, including a best fit line
* Determine the equation for the best fit line for these data.
* Assess the fit of your model - what assumptions/conditions are satisfied, which are not.

Your submission should include a knitted rmd file displaying all of your results.
